# Sort an array of Shape objects displayed on a javax.Swing GUI

<b>TOOLS: Java 17, Eclipse IDE </b><br>


- Created a UML Diagram to visually map out Java Classes, methods, global variables and Class relationships for a Shape Sorting application
- Identified the most appropriate and efficient design patterns to apply to make code flexable, reusable and maintainable
- Developed Java Swing widget that displays 8 shapes of random color, type and size after selecting the Load button and sorted in ascending order with Sort button
- Applied the Factory Design pattern in order to create shape objects without exposing their creation logic to the client
